# Drupal starter controller

## Getting started

1. Start by downloading the repository as a zip file or with a git clone.
2. Move the module starter to your Drupal modules folder.
3. Rename the module folder to the name of your module. The name should be all lowercase and use underscores.
4. Rename the following files to have the same name as your module does. This means you replace "drupal\_module\_starter" with your modules machine name (the same name as the folder).
  - drupal\_module\_starter.info.yml
  - drupal\_module\_starter.module
  - drupal\_module\_starter.routing.yml
5. Now open up the **.routing.yml** file and replace drupal\_module\_starter in the first routes machine name with your modules name.
6. Open up the **.info.yml** file and change the name and description of your module.
7. You're now ready to install the module and begin development!
